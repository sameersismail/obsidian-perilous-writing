# Perilous Writing

An [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) plugin which *demands* writing output, at the threat of bludgeoning your in-progress work. Emulates [Manu Ebert's](https://github.com/maebert) excellent [The Most Dangerous Writing App](https://github.com/maebert/themostdangerouswritingapp).


# Usage

> **Warning:** If a session is not completed successfully then your in-session work will be **irrevocably deleted**. Caveat emptor.

1. Install the plugin. See below.
2. Open the command palette and choose either a short session (default of five minutes) or a long session (default of ten minutes). (The respective durations can be changed in the settings tab.)

3. A light gray bar will appear at the top of the editor. It represents the session's progress. The session will begin after the next keypress.

4. Begin writing. If you stop writing for five seconds your in-session additions will be **deleted**. You'll be warned after two seconds of inactivity.

5. Only new characters reset the timerâ€”backspace does *not*. Neither do normal-mode operations under Vim emulation.
